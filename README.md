# US-ROAD-ACCIDENTS-ML-PROJECT

- Problem Statement:
   Develop a supervised classification model that accurately predicts the severity of an accident based on road, weather, and environmental factors, enabling authorities and navigation systems to anticipate and respond to accidents more effectively.
- Solution:
  Achieved ~83.6% accuracy with a balanced F1-score across classes after data balancing. Identified strong model performance for common accident levels and areas for improvement for rare, severe ones.
